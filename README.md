# 2D shooter

_This is a simple 2D shooter game inspired by The Binding of Isaac and made for the course Programming 3 of BME._

## Gameplay

The game is played on a map of 3x3 Matrix of rooms, each of which have to be cleared in order to win the game.
The enemies are the skeletons who can shoot at you with their laser guns. Defend yourself, if you kill them they might drop
strength or healing potions. Don't forget to check the barrels! ;)

## Disclaimer

This is a reupload of an old project I made years ago. I reuploaded it out of love and nostalgia, checked if it can be ran from vscode and played a couple games. If you try to run it and it doesn't work on your system I'm sorry! :D

## Pictures

I hand drew every pixel, hope you like my shoddy work!
